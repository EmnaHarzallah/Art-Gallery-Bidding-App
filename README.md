# Art-Gallery-Bidding-App
This project was initially part of a technical test for the Orange Summer Challenge 2025, which I was unable to complete. I’m now revisiting it at my own pace, focusing on mastering each step to ensure I achieve a polished and successful result.
The purpose of the test is to build an online art gallery where users can upload artworks (like paintings or wall art), view others’ art, and bid on them using a virtual in-app coin system , with the following steps : 
 Step 1 – Project Setup & Basic Backend (CRUD)
 Step 2 – Frontend Integration
 Step 3 – Advanced Filtering (Search + Tags + Price)
 Step 4 – Authentication System
 Step 5 – Auction Lifecycle: Cron + Subscriptions
 Step 6 – Real-Time Bidding System with Socket.io
 Step 7 – Wallet System & Transaction Emails
 Step 8 – Bidding History & Homepage Feed (Bonus)
